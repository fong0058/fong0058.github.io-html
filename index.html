                Hi. I'm Yik Hang Fong and I arrived in Canada on 11<sup>th</sup> August. <abbr title="Hong Kong">HK</abbr> is my home country which is a busy city with lots of energetic people. I studied furniture design before and now looking for an opportunity to change my career path, to find what I want to do for the rest of my life.

                Studying abroad is challenging for me when I am not a talkative person even with using Cantonese. <em>But I am curious about new things and willing to learn at my own pace.</em> I like listening to the opinions of someone that has different values. When it comes to conflict, I won't judge or argue with them. Free free to talk to me :)
