                    Hi. I'm Yik Hang Fong and I arrived in Canada on 11<sup>th</sup> August. <abbr
                        title="Hong Kong">HK</abbr> is my home country which is a busy city with lots of energetic
                    people. I
                    studied furniture design before and now looking for an opportunity to change my career path, to find
                    what I want to do for the rest of my life.

                        I'm at that stage in my life where I keep myself out of unnecessary arguments, so, even if you
                        tell
                        me 1+1=5, you're absolutely correct, enjoy. <cite>â€• Keanu Reeves</cite>

                    Studying abroad is challenging for me when I am not a talkative person even with using Cantonese.
                    <em>But I am curious about new things and willing to learn at my own pace.</em> I like listening to
                    the
                    opinions of someone that has different values. When it comes to conflict, I won't judge or argue
                    with
                    them. Free free to talk to me :)
